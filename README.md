Image compression using K-means clustering algorithms

* Using K-means clustering, we will perform quantization of colours present in the image which will further help in  compressing the image.
* In a coloured image, each pixel is of size 3 bytes (RGB), where each colour can have intensity values from 0 to 255. 
* Following combinatorics, the total number of colours which can be represented are 256*256*256. 
* Practically, we are able to visualize only a few colours in an image. 
* Shown below is an image of 1280 x 720 pixels taking 1.71 MB in PNG format. PNG is a lossless compression technique for images. 

* **Our objective is to compress the image further using colour quantization, though the compression will be lossy.**
